Proposed question
 ----------
 Introduction: Have you ever watched a game of golf on TV? Golf is a popular sport that is played all around the world. It is a game where players use special clubs to hit a small white ball into a series of holes in as few strokes as possible. Golf courses are filled with many challenges such as bunkers, water hazards, and trees, which make the game exciting and strategic.

Question: Imagine you are a professional golfer playing in a championship tournament. You are on the last hole and tied with another player for first place. The hole is surrounded by water on three sides and is known for being very difficult to reach. You have one shot left to win the tournament. How would you approach this challenging situation and what strategy would you use to make your shot? Use evidence from what you know about golf to support your answer.

 I would use a long club and try to hit the ball really hard. I would aim towards the hole and hope it goes in. Golf is about accuracy and skill, so I would try my best to make the shot.

Response: I would use a long club and try to hit the ball really hard. I would aim towards the hole and hope it goes in. Golf is about accuracy and skill, so I would try my best to make the shot.

Feedback:
- The response is connected to the topic of golf and is relevant to the question.
- The student mentions using a long club, which can help cover more distance.
- The student acknowledges the importance of accuracy and skill in golf.

However, the response lacks specific evidence from what the student knows about golf. Additionally, the strategy suggested is simple and does not consider the challenges of the last hole. To improve, the student could provide specific techniques or strategies that golfers use in difficult situations, such as accounting for wind, aiming for a safe spot, or using a different club to hit a shorter shot.
