 Question: Think about a time when you watched or played a baseball game. What do you think makes baseball an exciting sport to watch or play? Give specific reasons and examples from your own experience to support your answer.

Response:
I like baseball because it's fun to play with friends.

Feedback:
This answer does not fully address the question. It only mentions that baseball is fun to play with friends, but does not provide any specific reasons or examples to support this claim. Additionally, the question asked about both watching and playing baseball, so it would be beneficial to include thoughts about both aspects.
